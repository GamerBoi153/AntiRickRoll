## What it Blocks
Any YouTube video that purposely hides/puts the song for trolling
#
Rickroll websites that generates links to unrelated domains that end up playing the video
#
Discord Link Hiders that could hide Rick Roll links as something else abusing by Discords embed feature


## Why does this exist?
To make sure the dead meme dies and also because I was bored.



## How To Help Us
Find any link (video, website) that purposely rick rolls thats not detected in the JSON and make a issue with the "Rick Roll Found" tag and paste the url!
